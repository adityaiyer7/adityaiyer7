## About me
My name is Aditya, I'm a recent graduate from the College of Computing, Data Science and Society at UC Berkeley where I double majored in Data Science and Statistics. 

Previously, I:
- Built a low latency (<5ms) NLP based search engine for efficient medical code retrieval.
- worked with the IGI team to create a model that can predict missing/corrupt RNA sequences.
- worked with a startup to help improve their LLM fine tuning speed by 95%.

Currently, I'm:
- Building a Jarvis style personal assistant to boost productivity.
- Working and learning how to make LLM systems more efficient and reliable.
- Learning more math to understand ML theory.
